(* Testing Plan: To test and ensure the correctness of our project we
   used a combination of OUnit and manual tests. In general, for any
   function that was based on random chance or produced different
   outputs every time we ran it, we used manual tests. And for any
   function that was designed to produce the same output for every
   input, we tested with OUnit. We also choose not to include helper
   functions in our OUnit tests, because we tested other functions that
   were dependent on the correctness of the helpers.

   OUnit: Our OUnit test suite composed of tests from 6/7 of our central
   modules: Territories, Cards, Player, Draft, Battle, and Fortify. We
   chose to omit the Init module from our test suite because this module
   handled the setup of the game, which is partially based on random
   chance. Each time a game is run with the Init module a randomized set
   of territories and troops is distributed to each player, so we tested
   the game initialization code with manual testing. For the remaining
   modules we tested all of the functions in them, minus helper
   functions or functions that were based on chance or randomization.

   Manually: We chose to manually test function like [fully_init_game],
   [odds_main], and [battle simulator] because they produced varying
   outputs every time they ran. For example, to test [odds_main], which
   shows probability of player winning attack based off simulations, we
   compared the official Risk combat statistics to the general numbers
   we were getting from out simulations. If we got 84.76% or 85.41% odds
   of winning an attack and the official statistics read 85%, we
   consider that case to be correct. For other functions that also
   relied on randomization, we used a similar testing methodology.

   The test cases were developed for this project with a combination of
   black-box and glass-box testing strategies. Black-box tests were
   developed by following the specifications for functions from the MLI.
   Specifically, the inputs we used for the test cases involved typical
   inputs, paths through specification, and boundary cases. Black-box
   testing was a good start for the test cases, but wasnâ€™t enough, so we
   also incorporated glass-box testing. With glass-box testing we
   checked that every path for functions was. To do this we incorporated
   different inputs and ensured that they reached every path in the
   functions.

   Our testing approach proves the correctness of the system because we
   used a thorough approach involving black-box and glass-box testing.
   Each path of the functions was covered and a variety of inputs were
   tested given the specifications in the MLI (typical, boundary,
   paths). In addition, the functions that were based on randomness were
   manually tested. We also tested our project by simply playing the
   game. In the end our game is fully playable and functional. Overall,
   our project was thoroughly tested and proven correct. *)
